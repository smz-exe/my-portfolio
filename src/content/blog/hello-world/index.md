## Introduction

Hi there. Welcome to the "Digital Void" – my dev portfolio and tech blog.
I'm going to log my dev notes, learning memos, and sometimes personal thoughts here.
To kick things off, I'm writing about how this web site came to be.

## The first personal website

It has been four years since I started programming.
During this time, I've built a lot of applications, ranging from personal CLI tools to consumer-facing web apps used by thousands of people. Through these experiences, I became familiar with web development, but one thought suddenly crossed my mind: _"I've never built my own website."_

Many developers build their portfolio first – often as their very first projects.
Driven by this sudden impulse, I searched for a domain and grabbed [smz.sh](https://smz.sh).

I immediately started working on the landing page and the "About Me" section, and even drafted a few blog posts I wanted to share. ... That was last December.
Now, two months have passed without a single post. What the... Time flies.

Of course, I have an excuse for this procrastination.
I needed to finish my graduation thesis by late-January, which meant wrapping up my experiments and writing everything in a proper academic format.
On top of that, I had five final exams and several reports due at the same time.
I naively packed my schedule for the fall semester without considering the workload of my thesis.

Anyway, I've finished the exams, reports, and the paper.
Now I can finally restart this portfolio project.
Before ending this entry, let me briefly mention this site's stack.

## The stack

This site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/).
It is my first time using this framework.
So, why did I choose it?
Part of it was curiosity, but the main reason was practical: I was intrigued by the phrase, _"The web framework for content-driven websites."_

I know some people might say, "Hey, it's your portfolio, why don't you build everything yourself?"
Yeah, I understand that building it from scratch is cool.
But I wanted to ship this site as soon as possible.
For this project, I want to focus on the content rather than the engineering.
So, I decided to go with Astro.

(In the future, maybe I'll build a personal site from scratch – but not today.)

## Conclusion

Thanks for reading to the end.
I plan to post technical notes and personal updates regularly, so please check it out.
Peace.

**P.S.** I'm really pleased with this domain, [smz.sh](https://smz.sh). It feels like I'm finally executable.
